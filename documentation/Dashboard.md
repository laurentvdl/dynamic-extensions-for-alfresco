# The Dynamic Extensions Dashboard

## Manually installing OSGi bundles through the Control Panel

Aside from the Bundle REST API, Dynamic Extensions also offers a Control Panel UI for managing extensions.

Assuming a standard Alfresco Community installation with Dynamic Extensions installed you can access the Control Panel here:
[http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/dynamic-extensions/](http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/dynamic-extensions/)

You can install the bundle either by:

* Uploading the bundle through the Control Panel interface.
* Manually copying the bundle to the bundle installation directory. (The Control Panel shows the location.)
